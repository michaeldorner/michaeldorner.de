title: "Code Review"
---

Software engineering is not a one-man-show. Software engineering is inherently collaborative, requiring people with different skill sets and backgrounds to work together in building software systems of unprecedented complexity. To build better software and to build software better, we need to deeply understand and enhance collaborative software engineering practices like code review.

Code review is the discussion around a code change among developers and has become a core practice in collaborative software engineering.

In our research, we aim to understand code review not only as quality assurance practice but as communication network among developers.
