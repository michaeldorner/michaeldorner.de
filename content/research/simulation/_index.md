title: "Simulation"

Simulations are experiments with a model. Simulations play to their strengths when traditional experiments would have been too complex, too expensive, too lengthy, or simply not possible or accessible otherwiseâ€”like often in software engineering research.

If all parts of the experiment, i.e., the actors, their behaviours, and the context, are modelled as software, the simulation becomes an in-silico experiment or simply a computer simulation.

Therefore, simulations are ideal for software engineering research because they allow for the controlled, repeatable, and cost-effective testing of complex systems and scenarios that would be impractical or impossible to replicate in real-world environments like companies or software projects.
