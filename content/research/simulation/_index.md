title: "Simulation"
---

Simulations are experiments with a model. Simulations play to their strengths when traditional experiments would have been too complex, too expensive, too lengthy, or simply not possible or accessible otherwise. Those attributes match the objectives and setting of our research since experiments with whole software companies or open-source components are not feasible.

Since all models are abstractions and, accordingly, simplifications of reality, the quality of an simulation highly depends on the quality of the simulation model and its parametrization.

If all parts of the experiment, i.e., the actors, their behaviours, and the context, are modelled as software, the simulation becomes an in-silico experiment or simply a computer simulation.
