## Abstract

**Background:** Modern software systems are often too large, too complex, and evolve too fast for an individual developer to oversee all parts of the software and, thus, to understand all implications of a change. To maintain and enhance a collective understanding of the codebase and the changes to it, most modern collaborative software engineering projects rely on code review to foster informal and asynchronous discussions on changes and their impacts before they are merged into the code bases. Those discussions make code review a communication network where its participants exchange information and, when needed and deemed relevant, the information is passed on in subsequent code reviews. Although prior exploratory studies lay an important foundation in understanding code review as communication network, the confirmatory counterpart for this theory is missing. Without confirmatory research, the theory's validity remains uncertain, making it challenging to establish credibility, apply in practice, or advance further.

**Objective** In this thesis, we set out to fill this gap: Our objective is to make explicit the theory of code review as communication network and to empirically test its validity by quantifying the extent of information diffusion---the spread of information---in code review across varied perspectives, contexts, and conditions to determine when and how the theory holds. We also explore the theory's implications for both research and practice. Specifically, we position code review as a proxy for collaborative software engineering in the domain of tax compliance and provide foundation for a comprehensive discussion on how code review might evolve in the future.

**Methods:** We quantify information diffusion in code review using two complementary research approaches: On the one hand, we conducted an observational study at Spotify to measure the information diffusion in code review across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries. On the other hand, we developed and conducted *in-silico* experiments to estimate the upper bound of information diffusion in code review. For the parametrization of the simulations, we collected empirical data from closed-source code review at Microsoft, Spotify, and Trivago, as well as open-source code review at Android, Visual Studio Code, and React. To explore the implications of a more substentiated theoretical foundation of code review as communication network for research and practice, we measured cross-border code reviews within a multinational enterprise and surveyed 100 developers from SAP, Ericsson, and Nordea to understand their expectations for how code review practices may evolve in the near future.

**Results** Throughout our research, we have no evidence that could falsify the theory of code review as communication network: We observed extensive information diffusion across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries at Spotify and an unexpectedly high upper bound of information diffusion in closed-source code reviews indicates that yet code review is capable of spreading information effectively among its participants. However, we also found that information diffusion patterns in open-source code review systems differ significantly, suggesting that information diffusion in code review is not automatic, and that research insights based on open-source code review systems may not directly apply to closed-source environments. Building on a now more substantiated theoretical foundation, we can now rely on code review as a practical and robust proxy for collaborative software engineering in the context of tax compliance and derived from the insights we gained from the practitioners a rather we foresee a rather bleak trajectory for code review in the future in the realm of generative artificial intelligence.

**Conclusion:** Our work on understanding of code review as a communication network contributes not only to theory-driven, empirical software engineering research but also lays the foundation for practical implications such as code review as a measurable and reliable proxy for cross-border collaboration in the context of tax compliance and for discussions on the future of code review.
