## Abstract

**Background:** Modern software systems are often too large, too complex, and evolve too fast for an individual developer to oversee all parts of the software and, thus, to understand all implications of a change. To maintain and enhance a collective understanding of the codebase and the changes to it, most modern collaborative software engineering projects rely on code review to foster informal and asynchronous discussions on changes and their impacts before they are merged into the code bases. Those discussions make code review a communication network where its participants exchange information and, when needed and deemed relevant, the information is passed on in subsequent code reviews. Although prior exploratory studies lay an important foundation in understanding code review as communication network, the confirmatory counterpart for this theory is missing. Without confirmatory research, the theory's validity remains uncertain, making it challenging to establish credibility, apply in practice, or advance further.

**Objective** In this thesis, we set out to fill this gap: Our objective is to test the theory of code review as communication network by quantifying the extent of information diffusion---the spread of information---in code review across multiple perspectives that may or may not contradict the underlying theory or its universality and to explore two implications of a strengthened theoretical foundation for both research and software engineering practice: positioning code review as a proxy for collaborative software engineering in the context of tax compliance and offering a thorough discussion on how evolving practices may shape the future of code review.

**Methods:** We quantify information diffusion in code review using two complementary research approaches: On the one hand, we conducted an observational study at Spotify to measure the information diffusion in code review across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries. On the other hand, we developed and conducted *in-silico* experiments to estimate the upper bound of information diffusion in code review. For the parametrization of the simulations, we collected empirical data from closed-source code review at Microsoft, Spotify, and Trivago, as well as open-source code review at Android, Visual Studio Code, and React. To explore the broader implications, we measured cross-border code reviews within a multinational enterprise and surveyed about 100 developers from SAP, Ericsson, and Nordea to understand their expectations for how code review practices may evolve in the near future.

**Results** Throughout our research, we have no evidence that could falsify the theory of code review as communication network: We observed extensive information diffusion across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries at Spotify and an unexpectedly high upper bound of information diffusion in both closed-source and open-source code reviews indicates that code review is capable of spreading information effectively among its participants. We also found that code review serves a practical and robust proxy for collaborative software engineering in the context of code review and derived from the insights we gained from the practitioners a rather we foresee a rather bleak trajectory for code review in the future.

**Conclusion:** Our work on understanding of code review as a communication network contributes not only to theory-driven, empirical software engineering research but also lays the foundation for practical implications such as code review as a measurable and reliable proxy for cross-border collaboration in the context of tax compliance and for discussions on the future of code review.
