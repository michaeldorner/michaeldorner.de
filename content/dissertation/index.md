## Abstract

**Background:** Modern software systems are often too large and complex for an individual developer to fully oversee, making it difficult to understand the implications of changes. Therefore, most collaborative software projects rely on code review to foster asynchronous discussions about changes before they are merged. Although prior qualitative studies have shown that practitioners view code review as a communication network, no formal theory of code review as a communication network or empirical validation exists. Without confirmatory research, the theory's validity remains uncertain, hindering its credibility, practical application, and further development.

**Objective:** In this thesis, our objective is to (1) formalize the theory of code review as a communication network, focusing on information diffusion---the spread of information---as a core characteristic of communication networks, (2) empirically validate the theory by quantifying information diffusion in code review across varied perspectives, contexts, and conditions, and (3) demonstrate its practical application in the context of tax compliance within collaborative software engineering.

**Methods:** To empirically validate the theory, we use three complementary research approaches. First, we quantify information diffusion using an observational study at Spotify, measuring how information spreads across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries in code review. Second, we developed and conducted *in-silico* experiments with closed-source code review systems from Microsoft, Spotify, and Trivago, as well as open-source code review systems from Android, Visual Studio Code, and React, to estimate the capability of code review to facilitate information diffusion. Third, we surveyed practitioners on their anticipations for the future of code review to assess how these changes might impact our understanding of code review as a communication network.

**Results** Throughout our comprehensive empirical validation, we found no evidence that would falsify the theory of code review as a communication network. We observed extensive information diffusion across social, organizational, and architectural boundaries at Spotify. Additionally, we discovered that code review effectively spreads information quickly and widely among participants, even at a large scale. However, we also found that information diffusion patterns in open-source code review systems differ significantly, suggesting that findings from open-source environments may not directly apply to closed-source contexts. Through applying the theory of code review as a communication network, we were able to uncover the significant and uncovered tax risks associated with collaborative software engineering within multinational enterprises. While practitioners consider code review also in the future a core practice in collaborative software engineering, we foresee that generative AI could undermine its role as a human communication network in the future.

**Conclusion:** Our work on understanding code review as a communication network contributes not only to theory-driven, empirical software engineering research but also lays the groundwork for practical applications, particularly in the context of tax compliance. Future research is needed to explore the evolving role of code review as a communication network.
