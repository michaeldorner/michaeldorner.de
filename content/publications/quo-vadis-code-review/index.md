## Abstract

Code review has long been a core practice in collaborative software engineering. In this research, we explore how practitioners reflect on code review today and what changes they anticipate in the near future. We then discuss the potential long-term risks of these anticipated changes for the evolution of code review and its role in collaborative software engineering.
